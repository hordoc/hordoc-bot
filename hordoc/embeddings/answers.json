Check the error message: If the worker gives an error message about IP or any other issue, try to understand what it means and how to fix it. You can search for the error message online or consult the documentation of the software or hardware you are using. For example, if the error message is related to the network connection, you may need to check the firewall settings, the router configuration, or the IP address allocation.\n\n2. Try different models or settings: If the worker is not working properly with the current model or power settings, you can try other models or higher power settings that your hardware can handle. However, be careful not to overload your system or cause any damage to the hardware. You can also consult the specifications of your hardware or the recommendations of the software vendor to find the optimal settings.\n\n3. Monitor the worker's performance: If the worker is periodically executing requests, you can monitor its performance to see if there are any patterns or anomalies that may cause it to stop working. You can use monitoring tools such as Task Manager, Performance Monitor, or third-party software to track the CPU usage, memory usage, network traffic, or other metrics that may affect the worker's performance.\n\n4. Restart the worker: If the worker has stopped working and is not responding, you can try to restart it by pressing Enter or using the software interface. However, if the worker keeps stopping frequently, you may need to investigate the root cause and fix it properly.\n\n5. Seek help from experts: If you are not sure how to handle the worker or if you have tried various solutions but still cannot solve the problem, you can seek help from experts in the relevant field. You can post your question on forums, social media, or Q&A sites such as Stack Overflow, Reddit, or Quora, or contact the support team of the software or hardware vendor.

You can use the Task Manager in Windows to monitor your system resources.\n\n6.
